The CSS property `calc()` might lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For instance, if you try to calculate a width based on percentages and pixels, unexpected results can occur if you don't use parentheses appropriately.  Another common issue is forgetting that `calc()` requires units for every value, including the final result.
